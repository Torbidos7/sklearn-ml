# sklearn-ml

This repository is dedicated to exploring various techniques used in Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. The focus is on understanding and implementing different stages of a machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Topics Covered

1. **Data Preparation**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models.
2. **Scalers**: Understanding different scaling techniques and their impact on model performance.
3. **Preprocessing**: Techniques for transforming raw data into a format suitable for machine learning.
4. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Implementing PCA for dimensionality reduction.
5. **Classifiers**: Exploring different classification algorithms provided by Scikit-learn.

Each topic includes code examples and explanations to help understand the concepts better.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical guide to using Scikit-learn for machine learning. It is mainly for self-learning purposes and is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to Scikit-learn. I hope you find it useful.
